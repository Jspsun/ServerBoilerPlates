# Jonatan's Boilerplate Emporium

Just a few boilerplates for different types of servers

### I've put together ready-to-deploy:
- Flask
  - Server for REST API
  - Server for String Queries
  - Client for REST Interactions
  - Client for String Queries
- Express
  - Server for REST API
  - Client for REST Interactions

*The clients are more for just any language but it was nicer to sort them like this*

Also, all of these are ready to deploy via Heroku! I was considering using submodules to better organize everything but alas, then I'll have too many repos
