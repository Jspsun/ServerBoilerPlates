# Jonathan's Boilerplate Emporium

Just a few boilerplates for different types of servers and the related clients

---

### I've put together a ready-to-deploy:

- Express
  - Server for REST API
  - Server for String Queries
  - [ ] Client for REST Interactions
  - Client for String Queries

- Flask
  - Server for REST API
  - [ ] Server for String Queries
  - Client for REST Interactions
  - [ ] Client for String Queries

---

*The clients are more for just any language but it was nicer to sort them like this*

#### Also, all of these are ready to deploy via Heroku! I was considering using submodules to better organize everything but alas, then I'll have too many repos
